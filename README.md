Compendium is a note-taking app made to help organize ideas and annotations surrounding books, articles, and other literary works. Take comprehensive notes for essays, writing projects, personal study, and more. This application was written in Typescript with React, and is hosted through Netlify. The book search feature is powered by Google's Books API. The primary aim of this project was to create a useful application with functionality for posts, deletion, and modification of entries that also incorporated a REST API. This project was the first one I designed and completed that made use of an API. You can visit the live site [here](https://compendiumapp.netlify.app/).
